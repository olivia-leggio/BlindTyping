plain interface like problemwords
	maybe option for doing random words vs text samples?

shows a couple words at a time, maybe three
	including punctuation etc
	they disappear when you start typing
	doesn't show what you're typing
		if errors: shows them highlighted when you finish those words
		if none, just moves on
word list or text samples stored in json

definitely want to track error rate, not sure about tracking wpm
	it wouldn't be hard, I'm just not sure if I would like
